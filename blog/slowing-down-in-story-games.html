    <h1>Slowing Down in Video Games</h1>
	<p style="text-align: right;">2025-07-18</p>
	<p>Recently I found myself replaying the campagne of Red Dead Redemption 2. It is a fantastic story and an incredible world, ready for you to explore.</p>
	<p>In my first playthrough I pushed the story a lot, skipping side missions and rarely exploring the world.</p>
	<p>For my second playthrough I set out with the goal to maximize roaming around, going hunting, and completing side missions. This proved to be a wonderful experience. I stopped using fast-travel and choose to ride by horse instead. On the way I picked up as much side-quests as possible. Seeing something interesting in the distance, let's check it out.</p>
	<p>In a singleplayer game no one is stressing you. You won't get extra points for rushing through the story. It does not mean you need to waste your personal time. You can still just play one or two hours and in the end you will get to enjoy your favourite games for a longer time.</p>
	<p>I will definetely enjoy Red Dead Redemption 2 for a while and I have already found more games, which will need a more relaxed second playthrough. Looking forward for a second round of Cyberpunkt 2077.</p>
	<p>Have fun playing games.</p>
	<p>Cheers!</p>
